# Sprint Review and Retrospective - README  

## Overview  
This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my final project in this course CS-250. This artifact showcases the Agile and Scrum practices applied throughout the development process, highlighting key learnings and reflections on iterative development, teamwork, and continuous improvement.  

## Reflection  

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
Interpreting user needs requires gathering requirements through direct communication, research, and feedback. The most important part of user requirements is understanding the acceptance criteria and what the end results need to be. This ensures the most success by providing a clear definition of when a feature is complete and meets expectations. User stories help frame these needs in a structured format, ensuring that features align with the user’s expectations and business goals. By breaking down requirements into manageable tasks, user stories guide development efforts and provide clear acceptance criteria. This approach enhances usability and ensures that the final product addresses real-world needs.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I approach program development iteratively, emphasizing flexibility and responsiveness to change. Agile processes such as Scrum, sprint planning, and daily stand-ups allow for continuous feedback, making it easier to refine requirements and improve the product. I focus on success metrics and end results to ensure that development work is not wasted nor repeated. By defining clear objectives and measurable outcomes, I can align development efforts with project goals, minimizing inefficiencies. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate backlog grooming, sprint retrospectives, and test-driven development to ensure code quality and adaptability in dynamic environments.  

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a good team member means contributing actively, communicating effectively, and collaborating to achieve shared goals. It involves providing constructive feedback, assisting others when needed, and maintaining accountability for assigned tasks. Additionally, it requires adaptability to changing requirements and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. Strong teamwork ensures that projects are completed efficiently and with high-quality outcomes.
